# How to contribute

Thank you for being interested in aXeSiA and reading this.

This is my first open source project so I hope I am doing it right. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

## Practicalities

I like to use feature branches that can then be merged into main branch.
Feature branches should be mapped to issue, by the issue number, so that we can follow up on them in the issues and projects tabs.

What to do?

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/BogdanCerovac/aXeSiA
cd aXeSiA
npm install
```

2. Select existing issue you would like to resolve or maybe make a new one if you wish and then make a branch for it from main

I like to have branches named like this, with issue number: `feature/#[issue number here]-short-issue-title`

```
git checkout main
git pull main
git checkout -b feature/#[issue number here]-short-issue-title
```

3. do your magic, please test and comment and then push feature branch

Wish you luck :)

4. make a pull request to main branch

I will have to check the code, run it and test it before it can be merged to main. Maybe I will add some comments or propositions before it will be merged.
Will try to be quick but please note that I have limited time capacity.
